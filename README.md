## Todo List
* ~~Fix fonts so they work in other browsers (eg, firefox)~~
* ~~Fix touch and mouse events so they are more accurate when mapped onto grid of cells~~
* ~~Fix resize for computers so arrays resize~~
* Add/fix resize and for mobiles too
* Fix wrap around of grid
* Turn off scrolling for overflow of grid
